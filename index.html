                        <h1>How does the Internet work?</h1>
                        <p>The Internet is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible. At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together.</p>

                        <p>The history of the Internet is somewhat obscure. It began in the 1960s as a US-army-funded research project, then evolved into a public infrastructure in the 1980s with the support of many public universities and private companies. The various technologies that support the Internet have evolved over time, but the way it works hasn't changed that much: Internet is a way to connect computers all together and ensure that, whatever happens, they find a way to stay connected.</p>

                        <h1>Internet and the web</h1>
                        <p>As you might notice, when we browse the Web with a Web browser, we usually use the domain name to reach a website. Does that mean the Internet and the Web are the same thing? It's not that simple. As we saw, the Internet is a technical infrastructure which allows billions of computers to be connected all together. Among those computers, some computers (called Web servers) can send messages intelligible to web browsers. The Internet is an infrastructure, whereas the Web is a service built on top of the infrastructure. It is worth noting there are several other services built on top of the Internet, such as email and IRC.</p>

                        <h1>Intranets and Extranets</h1>
                        <p>Intranets are private networks that are restricted to members of a particular organization. They are commonly used to provide a portal for members to securely access shared resources, collaborate and communicate. For example, an organization's intranet might host web pages for sharing department or team information, shared drives for managing key documents and files, portals for performing business administration tasks, and collaboration tools like wikis, discussion boards, and messaging systems.</p>
                        <p>Extranets are very similar to Intranets, except they open all or part of a private network to allow sharing and collaboration with other organizations. They are typically used to safely and securely share information with clients and stakeholders who work closely with a business. Often their functions are similar to those provided by an intranet: information and file sharing, collaboration tools, discussion boards, etc.</p>

                        <h1>How the web works</h1>

                        <p>Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.</p>

                        <p>TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our example, this is like a car or a bike (or however else you might get around).</p>

                        <p>DNS: Domain Name System is like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website. The browser needs to find out which server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP messages to the right place (see below). This is like looking up the address of the shop so you can access it.</p>

                        <p>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods.</p>
                        <p>Component files: A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different parts of the goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types:</p>
                            <p>Code files: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, though you'll meet other technologies a bit later.</p>
                            <p>Assets: This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website, such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.</p>
                            
                            <h1>web page</h1>
                            <p>A document which can be displayed in a web browser such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari. These are also often called just "pages."</p>

                            <h1>website</h1>
                            <p>A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often called a "website" or a "site."</p>

                            <h1>web server</h1>
                            <p>A computer that hosts a website on the Internet.</p>

                            <h1>search engine</h1>
                            <p>A web service that helps you find other web pages, such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo. Search engines are normally accessed through a web browser (e.g. you can perform search engine searches directly in the address bar of Firefox, Chrome, etc.) or through a web page</p>


                            <h1>Domain</h1>

                            <p>Domain names are a key part of the Internet infrastructure. They provide a human-readable address for any web server available on the Internet.

                                Any Internet-connected computer can be reached through a public IP Address, either an IPv4 address (e.g. 192.0.2.172) or an IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:db8:8b73:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:1337).</p>

                                <h1>Terminal:
                                    Basic Windows Commands</h1>
