    <h1>How does the Internet work?</h1>
    <p>
      The Internet is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that
      makes the Web possible. At its most basic, the Internet is a large network
      of computers which communicate all together.
    </p>

    <p>
      The history of the Internet is somewhat obscure. It began in the 1960s as
      a US-army-funded research project, then evolved into a public
      infrastructure in the 1980s with the support of many public universities
      and private companies. The various technologies that support the Internet
      have evolved over time, but the way it works hasn't changed that much:
      Internet is a way to connect computers all together and ensure that,
      whatever happens, they find a way to stay connected.
    </p>

    <h1>Internet and the web</h1>
    <p>
      As you might notice, when we browse the Web with a Web browser, we usually
      use the domain name to reach a website. Does that mean the Internet and
      the Web are the same thing? It's not that simple. As we saw, the Internet
      is a technical infrastructure which allows billions of computers to be
      connected all together. Among those computers, some computers (called Web
      servers) can send messages intelligible to web browsers. The Internet is
      an infrastructure, whereas the Web is a service built on top of the
      infrastructure. It is worth noting there are several other services built
      on top of the Internet, such as email and IRC.
    </p>

    <h1>Intranets and Extranets</h1>
    <p>
      Intranets are private networks that are restricted to members of a
      particular organization. They are commonly used to provide a portal for
      members to securely access shared resources, collaborate and communicate.
      For example, an organization's intranet might host web pages for sharing
      department or team information, shared drives for managing key documents
      and files, portals for performing business administration tasks, and
      collaboration tools like wikis, discussion boards, and messaging systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extranets are very similar to Intranets, except they open all or part of a
      private network to allow sharing and collaboration with other
      organizations. They are typically used to safely and securely share
      information with clients and stakeholders who work closely with a
      business. Often their functions are similar to those provided by an
      intranet: information and file sharing, collaboration tools, discussion
      boards, etc.

    <h1>How the web works</h1>

    <p>
      Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client
      device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from
      the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web
      browser.
    </p>

    <p>
      TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are
      communication protocols that define how data should travel across the
      internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an
      order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our example, this is like a
      car or a bike (or however else you might get around).
    </p>

    <p>
      DNS: Domain Name System is like an address book for websites. When you
      type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find
      the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website. The browser
      needs to find out which server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP
      messages to the right place (see below). This is like looking up the
      address of the shop so you can access it.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines
      a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like
      the language you use to order your goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Component files: A website is made up of many different files, which are
      like the different parts of the goods you buy from the shop. These files
      come in two main types:
    </p>
    <p>
      Code files: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
      though you'll meet other technologies a bit later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assets: This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a
      website, such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.
    </p>

    <h1>web page</h1>
    <p>
      A document which can be displayed in a web browser such as Firefox, Google
      Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari. These are also often
      called just "pages."
    </p>

    <h1>website</h1>
    <p>
      A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected
      together in various ways. Often called a "website" or a "site."
    </p>

    <h1>web server</h1>
    <p>A computer that hosts a website on the Internet.</p>

    <h1>search engine</h1>
    <p>
      A web service that helps you find other web pages, such as Google, Bing,
      Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo. Search engines are normally accessed through a web
      browser (e.g. you can perform search engine searches directly in the
      address bar of Firefox, Chrome, etc.) or through a web page
    </p>

    <h1>Domain</h1>

    <p>
      Domain names are a key part of the Internet infrastructure. They provide a
      human-readable address for any web server available on the Internet. Any
      Internet-connected computer can be reached through a public IP Address,
      either an IPv4 address (e.g. 192.0.2.172) or an IPv6 address (e.g.,
      2001:db8:8b73:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:1337).

    <h1>Terminal: Basic Windows Commands</h1>

    <h1>CMD: 11 basic commands you should know (cd, dir, mkdir, etc.)</h1>

    <h1>1. How to change the directory in CMD (CD in Command Prompt)</h1>
    <p>
      The first command from the list is CD (Change Directory). This command
      enables you to change the current directory or, in other words, to
      navigate to another folder from your PC.
    </p>

    <h1>
      How to go to the root of the drive, in CMD (CD\) The first iteration of
      the CD command you should know is CD\. It takes you to the top of the
      directory tree. To see how it works, after you open the Command Prompt,
      type: cd\ … and press Enter on your keyboard. You should see how the CD\
      command takes you to the top of the directory tree. In this case, to the
      C: drive.
    </h1>

    <p>
      The Command Prompt is not case sensitive, meaning that you can type
      commands using capital letters, lowercase, or any combination of them. The
      commands CD, cd, or Cd, all work the same way.
    </p>

    <a href="What is the Windows Terminal?"></a>

    <p>cd windows\system32\</p>

    <h1>
      How to change the parent directory in CMD (CD..) When you need to go one
      folder up, use the cd.. command. Let's assume that you’re inside the
      system32 folder and want to go back to the Windows folder. Type cd.. … and
      press Enter on your keyboard.
    </h1>
    <p>The effect is that your current directory changes to C:\Windows.</p>

    <h1>
      How to change directory in CMD to desktop (or other user folders) What
      about changing the directory in CMD to a personal folder, like your
      Desktop or Documents? It’s done the same way, using the CD command, but
      you need to know the locations of your personal folders. In both Windows
      10 and Windows 11, all user folders are found in: C:\Users\[username]\ For
      example, to change the directory in CMD to your Desktop, the command
      you’ll have to run is this: cd C:\Users\[your_user_name]\Desktop
    </h1>

    <p>
      Similarly, if you want to navigate to another user folder in CMD, run the
      same command but replace Desktop with the directory you need to get to.
      For example, if you want to change the path to your Documents folder, run:
      C:\Users\[your_user_name]\Documents
    </p>

    <p>
      TIP: Alternatively, instead of entering the name of your user folder
      manually, you can replace the path to a directory in CMD with the
      %userprofile% environment variable. Here’s an example of how to change the
      directory in CMD to Desktop: cd /d %userprofile%\Desktop
    </p>

    <h1>
      2. How to change the drive in CMD (Command Prompt) To access another
      drive, type the drive’s letter, followed by :. For instance, if you wanted
      to change the drive from C: to D:, you should type: d: … and then press
      Enter on your keyboard.
    </h1>

    <h1>
      To change the drive and the directory at the same time, use the cd
      command, followed by the /d switch. The /d parameter is used to change the
      current drive to a specific folder from another disk volume. For instance,
      if you are now on the D: drive and you want to go back to the Windows
      folder from the C: drive, you should type: cd /d C:\Windows … and press
      Enter on your keyboard, like in the following screenshot.
    </h1>
    <h1>DIR</h1>
    <p>
      … and press Enter. This displays a list of the files and folders contained
      in it, together with some details about each of them (the size and the
      date and time when they were last modified).
    </p>

    <h1>
      4. How to create a new directory with Command Prompt (MD in CMD) You can
      make a new folder using the MKDIR (Make Directory) or the MD command. The
      syntax of these commands is MKDIR Folder or MD Folder Let's say we need to
      create a new folder called Digital_Citizen_Life that is going to be placed
      in the D:\Digital_Citizen folder. To do that, we need to type: mkdir
      Digital_Citizen_Life … and then press Enter, as shown below.
    </h1>
    <h1>
      TIP: If you want to create a folder that contains spaces in its name, make
      sure to wrap its name between quotes or apostrophes. For example, if you
      want to create a folder called Digital Citizen, run the MD command like
      this: md “Digital Citizen” How to create a directory in CMD with spaces in
      its name To test if it worked, use the DIR command again. The newly
      created folder appears in the list.
    </h1>
    <h1>
      IMPORTANT: Do not forget that all these commands depend on your current
      location in the Command Prompt. For instance, if you are on the C: drive
      and type MKDIR test, the new folder is created in the root of the C:
      drive. Another way to create a folder without having to go to the desired
      location for it is to type the complete path of the new folder. For
      example, if you are working on the D: drive and you want to create a new
      folder in C:, called other_stuff, type: mkdir c:\other_stuff … and then
      press Enter.
    </h1>
    <h1>
      When you need to create a folder with subfolders at the same time, you can
      use this command: MKDIR Folder\Subfolder . For instance, if we type: mkdir
      Digital_Citizen_Tests\Beta\Test1 … three folders are created:
      Digital_Citizen_Tests, Beta, and Test1, in a tree-like structure.
    </h1>

    <h1>
      5. How to rename files and folders with Command Prompt (REN in CMD) To
      rename files and folders, you need to use the REN (Rename) command. To
      rename folders, type: ren Folder NewFolderName For example, if we wanted
      to rename the Digital_Citizen_Tests folder to Digital_Citizen_Final_Tests,
      we should run: ren Digital_Citizen_Tests Digital_Citizen_Final_Tests … and
      press Enter.
    </h1>

    <h1>
      To rename a file, use the same command, like this: ren filename.extension
      newname.extension For instance, to rename the Digital_Citizen_Picture1.bmp
      file to Image0.bmp, we have to run the command: ren
      Digital_Citizen_Image1.bmp Image0.bmp
    </h1>

    <h1>
      6. How to copy files in CMD (COPY in Command Prompt) The COPY command
      allows you to copy files from one location to another. To use this
      command, type: copy location\filename.extension
      newlocation\newname.extension Advertisement For example, let's use this
      command to copy the Image0.bmp file from the Digital_Citizen folder
      located on the D: drive to the D:\Digital_Citizen\Digital_Citizen_Tests\
      folder. To make things more interesting, we want the file to be named
      Testing_Picture1.gif. To do all that, we must type the command: copy
      D:\Digital_Citizen\image0.bmp
      D:\Digital_Citizen\Digital_Citizen_Tests\testing_picture1.gif … followed
      by Enter. You should also receive a confirmation of the operation, as you
      can see below.
    </h1>

    <p>
      If you are copying within the same directory, you do not have to include
      the path in the command. As an example, let’s copy
      Digital_Citizen_Notes.txt from D:\Digital_Citizen in the same folder, only
      with a different extension: let's say Digital_Citizen_Notes.docx. To do
      that, we have to run the command: copy Digital_Citizen_Notes.txt
      Digital_Citizen_Notes.docx
    </p>

    <h1>
      7. How to copy folders in CMD, including their contents (XCOPY in CMD) To
      copy a folder and its content from one location to another, use the XCOPY
      command: XCOPY /s /i Let's assume that we need to copy a folder from
      D:\Digital_Citizen to C:\Backup_Digital_Citizen. To do that, we have to
      run the command: xcopy /s /i d:\Digital_Citizen c:\Backup_Digital_Citizen
      The /s parameter ensures that all the directories and subdirectories are
      going to be copied, except the ones that are empty. The /i parameter
      creates a new directory if the destination folder does not exist and
      copies all the files in it.
    </h1>

    <h1>
      8. How to delete files with Command Prompt (DEL in CMD) The DEL (Delete)
      is used to delete files from the folders you have created. To delete all
      the files from a folder, you can run the command del folder For instance,
      let’s say we want to delete all the files from the Digital_Citizen_Tests
      folder found in the D:\Digital_Citizen directory. For that, you first open
      the Digital_Citizen folder in Command Prompt and then you run this
      command: del Digital_Citizen_Tests You must confirm the delete process by
      typing the letter y for Yes, and then pressing Enter. NOTE: To also delete
      hidden files from the folder, you must add the /h parameter. Also, note
      that the DEL command does not work for deleting folders - for that, you
      have to use the RD command, covered in the next section of this tutorial.
    </h1>

    <h1>
      If you need to delete a single file, use the DEL command followed by that
      file’s name. For instance, to delete the file Digital_Citizen_Notes.txt
      from D:\Digital_Citizen, we should run the command: del
      Digital_Citizen_Notes.txt Using the DEL command to delete a single file in
      Command Prompt Here is a list of useful DEL combinations that are worth
      mentioning: DEL *.DOCX … deletes all the files in the current folder that
      have the DOCX extension (you can use any file extension necessary, DOCX is
      just an example). DEL Test*.* … deletes all the files in the working
      folder whose names begin with Test. DEL *.* … deletes ALL the files in the
      current folder.
    </h1>

    <h1>
      9. How to delete a folder from CMD (RD in Command Prompt) The DEL command
      cannot be used to delete folders. Therefore we must use another command to
      remove any empty folder, which is RD: RD [Folder] We have previously
      deleted all the files from the Digital_Citizen_Tests folder. It is now
      time to delete the directory too, by typing: RD Digital_Citizen_Tests
      Using the RD command to delete folders in Command Prompt 
    </h1>

    <h1>10. How to launch
      an app from CMD (Command Prompt) To run a program from the Command Prompt,
      you can navigate to the folder that contains the executable and type the
      program’s name. For example, if you want to launch Control Panel using
      Command Prompt, go to C:\Windows\System32, where its executable is:
      control.exe. Let's see how this operation is done if you were in your user
      directory. First of all, change the working directory to the application's
      folder by typing: cd /d c:\windows\System32\ Then, type the name of the
      app’s executable file: control.exe … and press Enter. Launching an app
      from Command Prompt Alternatively, you can also run an app from CMD
      directly, no matter what folder you’re currently browsing, by specifying
      the app’s executable file and its full path in Command Prompt. Opening
      Control Panel from the previous example would look like this, regardless
      of your current directory in CMD: C:\Windows\System32\control.exe </h1>

      <h1>11. How
        to get help in the Command Prompt (HELP in CMD) To access help in the
        Command Prompt, you can use the HELP command: help … and then press Enter.
        This displays a list of all the available commands, as you can see below.
        The HELP command from Command Prompt If a particular command interests
        you, type help followed by the name of that command. Another way to do the
        same thing is to type the command’s name followed by the /? parameter. To
        test it, use help cd or cd/? … to display information about the cd
        command. In the picture below you can see the result: Using the HELP
        command or the /? parameter to find help in Command Prompt NOTE: This
        tutorial covers only a couple of commands for Command Prompt. If you want
        to delve deeper, you can also read: View system information and manage
        processes from CMD or PowerShell Command Prompt (CMD) - 8 network commands
